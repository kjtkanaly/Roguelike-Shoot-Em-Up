## General To Do Plans
[X] Git

[X] Basic attack mechanic demo

# Weekly Goal 4/11
[X] Setup attack slot objects under the attack dir
[X] Give each attack slot object a timer and mesh instance
[X] Practice Dummy demo
[X] AoE Attack Demo

# Attack Overhaul
Lets revamp how we handle attack pickup. Lets literally store a copy of the
attack object in each pickup object

# Attack Clean up
[X] Explore the base call feature
[X] Update the diagrams
[X] Make Obj diagram for attack generic

# NPC Devlopement
[X] Make Generic NPC Node
[X] Potentially overhaul the movement classes (atleast move them into common dir)
[X] Create Generic Enemy Node (Utilizes Generic NPC node)
[x] Make diagram for the NPC class levels
[ ] Make diagram for the attack object nodes
[X] Think through utilizing a generic enemy node
[X] Clean up the player node dir. We don't really need a dedicated node for each thing
[X] Perhaps we don't need a PlayerAttackDirector. Just PlayerInventory. That 
    stores the attack objects
[X] Continue working on the interaction director classes. Focus on damage
[X] Make a damage label that spawns when a character takes damage
[ ] curve/motion fx for the animation of the dmg value
[ ] Set the enemy motion controller to to just move towards the player at a
    constant speed
[ ] Get a demo scene together that spawns mutiple enemies in a pattern
[ ] Get Health, die, spawn demo together

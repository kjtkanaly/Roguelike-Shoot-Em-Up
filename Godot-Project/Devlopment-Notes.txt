# Development Notes
## Next time on Dragon Ball Z
- Work out/find a better curve/motion fx for the animation of the dmg value.
  However not high priotirty. 

- Keep working on overhauling the attackClasses and Resources to enable player
  taking damage. Also the newly coined "RepetativeAttack" Data and Director
  classes. Also this now implies a singular Attack.
  
- Update the diagrams. Add death animation, currently they just despawn which
  is not very poggers. Create a diagram that shows each collision object and
  then list their levels and masking values. This will serve as a good quick 
  ref.

## General Notes
### Version 
Godot Version: 4.2.1

### Collision Layer
- Layer: Sets the physics layer of the object
- Mask: Controls which layers the object collides with

### Groups
Can be used to organize child nodes and get only certain nodes

### Resource Files
Different instances of the same object will access the same file. They won't
get their own unique instance of the resource file. 

## General To Do Plans
[X] Git
[X] Godot
[X] VS Code
[X] UML Editor in VS Code

## Important To Do's
[X] Make sure EVERYONE is on the same version

## Useful Notes
[X] The shadow issue that Dak had was due to the Shadow flag
    uner the Light3D prop being set false


# Weekly Goal 3/3
[X] Basic attack mechanic demo

# Weekly Goal 4/11
[X] Setup attack slot objects under the attack dir
[X] Give each attack slot object a timer and mesh instance
[X] Practice Dummy demo
[X] AoE Attack Demo

# Attack Overhaul
Lets revamp how we handle attack pickup. Lets literally store a copy of the
attack object in each pickup object

# Attack Clean up
[X] Explore the base call feature
[X] Update the diagrams
[X] Make Obj diagram for attack generic

# NPC Devlopement
[X] Make Generic NPC Node
[X] Potentially overhaul the movement classes (atleast move them into common dir)
[X] Create Generic Enemy Node (Utilizes Generic NPC node)
[x] Make diagram for the NPC class levels
[ ] Make diagram for the attack object nodes
[X] Think through utilizing a generic enemy node
[X] Clean up the player node dir. We don't really need a dedicated node for each thing
[X] Perhaps we don't need a PlayerAttackDirector. Just PlayerInventory. That 
    stores the attack objects
[X] Continue working on the interaction director classes. Focus on damage
[X] Make a damage label that spawns when a character takes damage
[ ] curve/motion fx for the animation of the dmg value
[X] Set the enemy motion controller to to just move towards the player at a
    constant speed
[X] Get a demo scene together that spawns mutiple enemies in a pattern
[X] Get Health, die, spawn demo together
[X] Update the interaction diagrams
[X] Setup Player Model and Animation Controller
[ ] Setup Attacks on the Player
[ ] Create a Collision Diagram
[ ] Add death animations
